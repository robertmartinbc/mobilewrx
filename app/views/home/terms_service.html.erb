      <br>
      <h4>1. Use of Services</h4>

      <p class="justify">COMPANY offers online resources for social networking, commerce and content creation on MobileWRX.com, including communications tools, affiliate marketing, member to member sales, online forums, personalized content and branded programming.</p>

      <p class="justify">COMPANY offers MobileWRX.com to YOU, provided that YOU represent that YOU are of legal age to create binding contractual and financial obligations for any liability that YOU may incur as a result of YOUR use of MobileWRX.com.</p>

      <p class="justify">YOUR use of MobileWRX.com constitutes YOUR agreement with the Terms and the MobileWRX.com policies ("Policies") posted from time to time and the Privacy Policy, both of which are incorporated by this reference into the Terms. YOUR use of a particular MobileWRX.com service ("Service(s)") may be subject to specific guidelines ("Service-Specific Rules") posted from time to time and incorporated by this reference into the Terms. Use of the Services constitutes full acceptance of and agreement to the Service-Specific Rules.</p>

      <p class="justify">If YOU do not agree to these Terms, then YOU are not granted rights to use MobileWRX.com or any of ITS Services, and YOU should refrain from accessing MobileWRX.com and ITS Services. If YOU violate any of these Terms, YOUR permission to use MobileWRX.com automatically terminates.</p>

YOU should check the web site from time to time to review these Terms, because they are binding on YOU. Any revisions to these Terms will not apply to Promotions purchased prior to the effective date of such revisions. These changes will be effective immediately for new users of our site and for all Promotions purchased after the effective date of the change. Certain provisions of these Terms may be superseded by expressly designated legal notices or terms located on particular pages of the web site. YOUR use of the web site after we update the terms indicates that YOU accept the revised Terms.</p>

      <p class="justify">Please note that there are risks, including but not limited to the risk of physical harm, of dealing with strangers, including persons who may be acting under false pretences. Please choose carefully the information YOU post on this web site and that YOU give to other web site users. YOU assume all risks associated with dealing with other users. We expect that YOU will use caution and common sense when using this web site.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>2. Purchasing MobileWRX Promotions</h4>

      <p class="justify">WE identify offers, which are referred to in these Terms as "Deals", that various merchants of goods and services ("Merchants") are interested in providing to customers. We act as intermediaries in these Deals involving the Promotions ("Promotion(s)") of Merchants, and sell them to YOU pursuant to these Terms (each such transaction, a "Contract").</p>

      <p class="justify">WE sell several different types of Promotions through our web site.  All Promotions are available for purchase only for a limited time. They may be limited in quantity. WE are not the supplier of the goods and/or services under the Deal. These will be supplied by the Merchant, upon whose behalf WE sell the Promotions to YOU, and who is responsible for redeeming the Promotion which YOU have purchased. The Merchant has agreed with us that it will redeem the Promotions sold to YOU through this site. Each Promotion is subject to these Terms and any terms appearing on the Promotion.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>3. Status and Relationship to Merchant</h4>

      <p class="justify">By placing an order through our site, YOU confirm that YOU are legally capable of entering into binding contracts, and are at least 18 years old.  YOU covenant and agree that the Merchant is the provider of the goods and/or services under the Deal and will be responsible for ensuring the Deal and the goods and/or services provided thereunder comply with all applicable laws. YOU covenant and agree that the Merchant assumes all liability for the performance of the services or the provision of the goods identified on the Promotion.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>4. Company Obligations</h4>

      <p class="justify">When YOU complete the online purchase, WE will send YOU the Promotion as soon as reasonably practicable after receiving YOUR payment for it. WE may send it electronically to the email address YOU have provided, or by other means, in our discretion.  Our obligations under this Agreement are solely to sell the Promotion to YOU under the Deal. WE are not the seller of the goods and/or services which are the subject of the Deal. The Merchant is solely responsible for supplying such goods and/or services and redeeming the Promotion in accordance with ITS terms.  WE will disclose YOUR customer information related to the Promotion that YOU have purchased for the Deal to the Merchant to allow the Merchant to satisfy the terms of the Deal.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>5. Registration Obligations</h4>

      <p class="justify">In order to access certain Services, YOU may be required to register and obtain an account with MobileWRX.com.</p>

      <p class="justify">When registering, YOU must: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information (collectively, the "Registration Data") and (b) update the Registration Data as necessary. If, after investigation, WE have reasonable grounds to suspect that YOUR information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, WE may suspend or terminate YOUR account and prohibit any or all use of MobileWRX.com by YOU.</p>

      <p class="justify">YOU will receive a password and account designation upon completing a MobileWRX.com registration process. YOU are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of YOUR password and for all activities that occur through YOUR account. YOU agree to immediately notify COMPANY of any unauthorized use of YOUR password or account or any other breach of security. COMPANY will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from YOUR failure to provide accurate information or to keep YOUR password secure. Use unique numbers, letters, and special characters for passwords and log off from YOUR account at the end of each session.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>6. Consumer Rights</h4>

      <p class="justify">If YOU are contracting as a consumer, YOU may cancel a Contract within thirty days of purchasing a Promotion (provided that you have not exchanged the Promotion for the goods and services under the Deal in that time) by providing us with written notice.  In this case, YOU will receive a full refund of the price paid for the Promotion in accordance with our Return Policy. A copy of these Terms will be accessible at the URL address listed on the Promotion and/or in the emails sent to YOU upon purchasing the Promotion.  Upon cancellation of a Contract, WE will cancel YOUR Promotion and YOU will destroy any copies of the Promotion held electronically or in printed form.</p>

      <p class="justify">Occasionally, due to unforeseen circumstances, Merchants may close their doors or alter the types of goods and services they provide before the Expiry Date. Should this occur, any unused, valid Promotions will be removed from YOUR account and replaced with MobileWRX credits equal to the value originally paid. Only refunds back to YOUR credit card will be provided on Promotions less than 30 days from the purchase date.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>7. Price and Payment</h4>

      <p class="justify">The price of any Promotion in relation to a Deal will be as quoted on our site from time to time, except in cases of obvious error.  If there is an obvious pricing error in relation to the Deal which could have reasonably been recognized by YOU as a mis-pricing then WE have the right to cancel any Promotion issued in respect of the Deal and issue YOU a refund in respect of the same. For example, if the percentage discount listed in the Deal does not correlate with the price listed, this is an obvious pricing error.  Payment for all Promotions may be made by credit card, or by other payment means that WE make available from time to time through the web site. Deals cannot be combined with any other offer unless the Deal description expressly states otherwise. If YOU do not use the entire value of a Promotion when redeeming it, any remaining value is void. Applicable taxes and gratuities cannot be paid with a Promotion, and are paid separately and directly to the Merchant.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>8. Service Access</h4>

      <p class="justify">While WE endeavour to ensure that the web site is normally available 24 hours a day, WE will not be liable if for any reason the web site is unavailable at any time or for any period. Access to the web site may be suspended temporarily and without notice in the case of system failure, maintenance or repair or for reasons beyond our control.</p>
